# Low Level Programming

* **0-main.c, main.h:** the **0-main.c** file is used to compile and test another *.c* file to see if it gives the output *zero is zero* and the **main.h** contains the header prototypes for the functions.
* **1-main.c:** a part of the code written in here causes the output to go into an infinite loop, but it is commented out to avoid such.
* **2-main.c:** it checks for the largest amongst three integers, and then prints it to the screen.
* **3-main\_b.c:** it works in conjuction with **3-print\_remaining\_days.c** and **convert\_day.c** file to calculate present day from start of the year, and the number of days left.
