# Low Level Programming

* **0-strcat.c:** this file contains function that appends a source string to a destination string, overwriting the null-terminator, and then adds it at the end.
* **1-strncat.c:** the function written in it also concatenates two strings, except that it uses *n* to determine the number characters to be copied. (It does not need a null-terminator.)
* **2-strncpy.c:** it contains a function that copies a string from a source, to a destination, overwriting any string that has already been existing.
* **3-strcmp.c:** the written function compares two strings, and then returns a negative integer if the first string is lesser than the second, a positive integer if the first integer is greater than the second, and zero if they're equal.
* **4-rev_array.c:** the *reserve\_array* function reverses a number of elements in the array.
* **5-string_toupper.c:** the function contained in the file turns all lowercase strings into uppercase.
* **6-cap_string.c:** this behaves like the previous function, except that it capitalizes the first letter of every word.
* **7-leet.c:** the function encodes a string into 1337.
